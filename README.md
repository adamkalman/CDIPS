1) Put all these files into a local directory
2) Create empty subdirectories "Data" and "interdata"
3) Put avito_test.tsv and avito_train.tsv into "Data" (these files are over 1 GB, so they're not here. They are available from Kaggle.)
4) Change code at beginning of each file to match the correct local paths
5) Modify split.py to choose the training set size, then run it.
6) Run classifycategories.py, illicitcontent.py, mergeSolutions.py, and finalMerge.py, in that order.
